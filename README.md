<h1>Analysis on UK Lexical Variation</h1>

<b>Date completed:</b> February 24, 2023

<h2>Description</h2>
This project used R to analyse the lexical variation of "sweater", "jumper", and "pullover" in the UK based on geo-tagged tweets. 

<h2>Remarks</h2>

- Needs refinining and a larger dataset to have a more accurate analysis and comparison.
- Update 2024: Unfortunately, since Twitter API is no longer free (thanks a lot Elon), I am unable to carry out these changes.
